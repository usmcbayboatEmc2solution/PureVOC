NatSec-critical work (veteran hiring, innovation, critical minerals recovery) bears the burden without fair reciprocation. Mercy has limits — the system must stop feeding on the cause and start recirculating for the future.PureWORC SolutionA special reciprocating credit account for FDVFC-aligned work:
Taxes paid (federal/state income, payroll, etc.) by qualifying entities (vet-led operations, NatSec innovation, NIRD recovery) are credited back into a dedicated, ring-fenced account.
Funds recirculate for:  Veteran workforce transition/training  
R&D in critical minerals, defense technology, remediation  
Site recovery (tailings, wetlands)  
Ethical oversight (FDVFC hubs)

Key FeaturesReciprocating — 100% credit offset (or tiered 80–100% based on NatSec/vet impact score) — master-calculated for fairness (algorithm tied to contribution metrics: jobs created, minerals recovered, innovation output).  
Pre-Funded / Executive Authority — Built on existing tools:  Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) — Up to $9,600 per qualified veteran hire (40% of wages, highest tier for disabled/long-term unemployed vets).  
R&D Tax Credit (IRC §41) — 6–10%+ of qualified research expenses (permanent, no cap).  
DOMFIRA-style revolving accounts (10 U.S.C. § 2687a) — revenue self-sustains without new appropriations.  
No new Congressional legislation required — IRS/DoD executive rulings/guidance for special accounts.

No "Plus" — Voluntary participation only. No coercion. No mandatory disclosure. Constitutional bright lines enforced.  
Anti-Entropy Safeguards — Blockchain audits + PureVOC sieve for real-world accuracy reporting. Third-party verification. No lump-sum slush — every dollar traced to cause.

BenefitsFDVFC — Taxes support the cause (veterans, dignity, valor) instead of feeding waste.  
NatSec — R&D credits accelerate domestic critical minerals, defense innovation (SpaceX-style pull).  
Fairness — Master-calculated: Proportional to impact (e.g., 100% for high-vet/high-security work).  
Delaware Fix — Credit eligibility requires transparency (no shell games).  
Innovation Mindset — Recirculates capital into future-building, not DC entropy.

Next StepsExecutive consideration: IRS ruling for special credit account (similar to WOTC veteran offsets).
