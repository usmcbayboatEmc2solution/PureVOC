## Content Summary
Divorce exemplifies mercy's absolute breaking point. Courts/lawyers/systems feed on the corpus of families — a cattle-car mentality ("next") that extracts while abandoning source duty. No rebuilding, just entropy. Families pay for therapy, housing, lost income — the machine thrives, the center erodes. This is not justice; it's a license to print money off broken homes. Leadership (Congress) dictates the refinery personality — and right now it's predatory.

## Committed Artifact: Full PureNOTE Text

Divorce is 100% "mercy has limits."  
One asshole suffices; two colliding histories with table manners? Sometimes salvageable.  
But the system feeds while they struggle — disgusting, predatory, cattle-car "next."  
Lawyers ($270/hr avg, $15k–$100k+ cases) bill on contested custody/assets.  
No-fault meant less acrimony — yet contested cases drag, pockets line up.  
Reforms: Mandate mediation first (40–60% cost cut), cap fees, integrate therapy (60% fewer returns).  
Shift from adversarial to restorative — mercy with limits, not without.  
Congress? The refinery itself — bloated entropy.  
We end the feedlot. Families deserve better than "next."
