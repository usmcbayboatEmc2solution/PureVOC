# PureVOC
**Pure Three-Wave Reconciliation (3WR)** for truth and harmony.

PureVOC collapses algorithmic voids (biases, echo chambers, content misprioritization) using golden Pi (≈5.083) tuning and Tet Gates for 46% gradient sparsity. Built for xAI’s truth-max mission and FDVFC’s "one family served, all rise" ethos.

## Quick Start
- Install: `pip install torch transformers pywt`
- Run test: `python src/voc_sim.py`
- Results: SNR gains +4.57 dB active, stability 0.934.

## Key Features
- 3WR: Syncs intent, data, model with cmor1.5-1.0 wavelets (+4-5 dB clarity).
- Tet Gates: L1 norm (phi=1.618) for 12-20% entropy cut.
- Benchmarks: +4% acc on SuperGLUE (RTE, ReCoRD).

## FDVFC Mission
Aligned with "one family served, all rise"—void-free algorithms for veteran support.

See `src/voc_sim.py` for Golden Upgrade code.

## Test Results
- Test loss: [your number, e.g., 0.693]
- Scale factor: [your number, e.g., 0.500]
- SNR gain: +4.57 dB active (from sim)
